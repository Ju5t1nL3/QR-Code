# QR Code Generator

The code takes in user input for the version, error correction, box size, and border size. Afterwards, it prompts the user to enter any form of data, and then it will turn that data into a qr code! If you would like to try this out for yourself, download the program, run the program, and the qr code will automatically save in the same folder as the program. Make sure to also pip install qrcode image.
